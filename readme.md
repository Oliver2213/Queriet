#Queriet, the Quick ubiquitous extensible research interface enhancement tool
This project is in *extreme* alpha, but as it stands now, planned features are:

* quick access (via a global hotkey), to a dialog that allows you to search and display results for your term via the following sites (this list is subject to change):
  * Wikipedia
  * dictionary.com or another reputable online dictionary service
  * urbandictionary.com
  * Wolfram alpha
* Quick equation solving with sympy

All results will be displayed in the queriet window, with links to external sources for the respective service or site, if applicable.
